This is my website. Right now it's just a static coming soon page, but I plan to update it in the future.

## Is it useful?

No.

## Are there any interesting features?

It has both a light and dark color scheme and a little typing animation (if those even count as features).

## Does it work on all browsers?

Yes. It works on all modern browsers, as far as I know (the automatic color scheme may not work though).

## When will the site be updated?

Eventually. I will update the site when I feel like there is enough content to be worth it.
